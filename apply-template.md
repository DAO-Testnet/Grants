# Grant Project: Application Template

For Chinese templates, please refer to: [apply-template-zh](https://github.com/DAO-Testnet/Grants/blob/master/apply-template-zh.md)

The Committee provides community users two ways to participate in aelf’s development, encouraging an active ecosystem: Grant Projects and Bounty Projects:

* [Grant Projects](https://github.com/DAO-Testnet/Grants): When community users have good project ideas that will be beneficial to the aelf ecosystem, they can apply as a Grant project. The Committee will provide resources to aid the project’s development.
* [Bounty Projects](https://github.com/DAO-Testnet/Bounties): When the Committee sees the need to enhance aelf’s ecosystem, a Bounty project will be launched to allow community users to assist in project development.

Community users need to refer to this section when applying for [grant projects](https://github.com/DAO-Testnet/Grants). The following is for reference only, you need to provide a complete development delivery document based on the specific project circumstances.

**Note:** The detailed steps associated with this document can be found in the developer's instruction: [operation-guide](https://github.com/DAO-Testnet/Grants/blob/master/operation-guide.md) 

 

## Project Name

## Project Description
* Brief description - project design, functions, etc.
* Describe how and why the project will improve aelf’s ecosystem.

## Team Members and Experience
Describe the developers team and their development experience. You can provide us with a link to your team members’ Github Codebase, which will help the aelf Management Committee review the project.

## Team Website
Include your team website if you have one - [https://...](https://...)

## Team Code Reps
* [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your_rep_1>
* [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your_rep_2>

## Development Roadmap
The project can be divided into several stages according to development difficulty, practicability, or other factors. Each stage should have a detailed development plan, timing, and budget. Development delivery documents will be checked and accepted with reference to the development plan.

The project plan for each stage should include the following: 

* Stage cost: Determine the stage’s cost according to the overall development cost.
* Number of developers: total number of people involved in development.
* Development Time: The development time of each member or the total development time required to complete the stage.
* Project Development Content: Developers need to ensure that the project development content up to this stage is complete so that the aelf DAO management committee can review whether the project’s development conforms to the specifications.
* Project delivery documentation requirements: Developers are required to submit documents such as project requirement specification, project design specification, user instruction, test report, etc. 

 

The aelf DAO management committee divides grant projects into the following 3 levels according to factors such as the difficulty and practicability of the project development:

* Small-Scale projects: 5K～50K ELF
* Medium-Scale projects: 50K～200K ELF
* Large-Scale projects: ≥200K ELF

All projects shall be subject to, but not limited to, these three levels, which may be granted on an ad hoc basis according to the specific project’s contents. Different project levels may require different approval times: small or medium-scale projects need 1 week to review, large projects need 2 weeks to review.

Developers should apply for projects based on these three levels and determine their own project levels to choose the appropriate expiration date when applying for proposals in the aelf Explorer.

The aelf DAO Management Committee will support the investment of 15 projects per year, aside from any special approvals for particularly excellent projects.

 

**Here is an example of a development roadmap:**

* Project design description: Describe the project frame design, database design, etc. 
* Test report: Describe how the project was developed, the quality of development, the network environment, and how the software works.
* User guide instruction: Provide detailed user instructions for the software, making it easy for community users to use.
* Additional documentation

## Project Delivery Instructions
Participants (developers) are required to submit the Development Delivery Document (reference template: [deliver-template](https://github.com/DAO-Testnet/Grants/blob/master/deliver-template.md)) to the [deliver-docs folder of ‘Grant Project repository](https://github.com/DAO-Testnet/Grants/tree/master/deliver-docs)’, and apply for the proposal through the aelf Explorer. 

## Future Plans
Please briefly describe the future development plan and team’s vision.

## Additional Information
If there is any change or other important information on the project development, it can be noted here. 

Other possible information includes:

What has the project done?

Has the project applied for other grants?

Are there any other projects similar to this one? If so, how is your project different?
